# About My App
My static app that displays RnB Artist, the Weeknd’s name and logo in a png along with a clickable button and flashing text. I’ve made use of react native's stylesheet, text, view, image, and button imports

# PROPS
I declared a let variable named ‘picture’ and set the image uri, creating a prop I can call on whenever. From there when declaring my image source I called the variable picture. I’ve also created props in my stylesheet called container and bold.

# COMPONENTS
As for components I created a new button component in a separate file and imported it to my app.js file.

# STATE
I used State to make the text in my app “this is” flash from orange to black using setState and setInterval
